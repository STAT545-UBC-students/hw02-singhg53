# Homework Assignment #2
#### By: Gurjot Singh (singhg53)

Hello! Today we will be exploring a the dataset known as `gapminder`

For those who have not yet downloaded the dataset you can do so by installing the package by the function:

`install.packages("gapminder")`

Now since you have downloaded the dataset lets load it using the `library` function

```{r}
library(gapminder)
```

Let's also install and load the tidyverse package

`install.packages("tidyverse")`

```{r}
library(tidyverse)
```


The cool thing about the tidyverse package is that includes different functions that could be used like `ggplot2` and `dplyr`
